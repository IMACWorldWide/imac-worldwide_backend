# IMAC WorldWide - Backend

This is the backend repository for the IMAC WorldWide project, a web platform designed to centralize information about academic mobility opportunities for students in the IMAC engineering program at ESIEE Paris. The backend is built with TypeScript and Express and serves static data stored in JSON files.

## Get started

To set up and run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ImacWorldWide_backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment configuration).
